Was code book submitted to GitHub that modified and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?

#Hello
##Hello
###Hello
*Hello
**Hello
***Hello


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
