Was code book submitted to GitHub that modified and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?


#Code Book for Course Project


##Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

- Subject: the integer subject ID.
- Activity: the string activity name:
..* Walking
..* Walking Upstairs
..* Walking Downstairs
..* Sitting
..* Standing
..* Laying

##Merging and Manipulating Data

##Writing tidy data to text file


##Hello
###Hello
> yes this is a quote

*Hello



```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
